Allows you to toggle airplane mode from a floating icon that is always-on-top. Similar to the Messenger "Chat Head" feature.

NOTE: Requires root.

This was developed to deal with the OnePlus 5/5T/6/6T Qualcomm modem issue where the phone drops down to H+ (HSPA+) mode and sticks forever, or has trouble jumping to the next cell tower and drops the data connection. Simply tap the button and it cycles airplane mode instantly. You should reconnect at full 4G speed.

Why?
Safer while driving. Toggling airplane mode while driving requires multiple swipes and taps, distracting you from the road and is potentially dangerous. Once launched, this icon floats over all apps and is just one tap away. If you are a professional driver, this is a lifesaver.

TODO: Backwards compatibility for other devices. Currently only runs on Android Pie (API 28) and only tested on OnePlus 5T. This software is considered alpha, run at your own risk.
